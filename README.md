# 🚦 Traffic Sign Detection with Voice Feedback
This project is a Python-based application that uses OpenCV for real-time traffic sign detection and provides voice feedback for the detected signs using text-to-speech. It can be used in driver assistance systems to alert drivers about traffic signs through audio notifications.

A deep learning-based web application that **detects traffic signs in real-time**, shows the **probability of correctness**, and provides **voice feedback** of the detected sign. This project combines computer vision, machine learning, and a web interface to assist users in understanding road signs interactively.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Real-time **traffic sign detection** using a trained CNN model (Keras).
- 📊 Displays **detection probability** with high accuracy.
- 🗣️ **Voice output** using text-to-speech (pyttsx3) for detected signs.
- 🌐 Web-based UI using **Flask**.
- 📚 Trained using popular ML/DL libraries including `pandas`, `numpy`, `keras`, `matplotlib`.
- 🧠 Easily extendable for custom datasets and additional features.
